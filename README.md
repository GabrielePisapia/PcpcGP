# MPI WORD-COUNT CONCURRENT AND PARALLEL PROGRAMMING 2020/2021 

The following project involves the implementation of a parallel and concurrent solution for the word count problem, realized through open mpi in c. Realized by the student: Pisapia Gabriele.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem consists of reading a number of variable files, containing a random number of words, in order to read the words and count all occurrences in each file. Specifically, this task is realized through principles of parallel programming, so each processor involved has a portion of the file to analyze and to communicate the results with the other processors involved in the presentation of the solution.
